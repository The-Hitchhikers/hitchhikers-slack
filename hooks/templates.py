Hitchhikers Zen
==========

1.Polite
We always need to be polite, with a new members, or with your hitchhiker's mates, 
respect to others the right way building successful relationship model is all about respecting each other. 
Relationship in its turn is a key concept while building awesome tools.

2.Cultural difference
Because you communicating with different people time zones/religion/principles it's very individual cases, 
and if an things sounds good for you, for another person it's can be an disappointed moment.

3.Teach
When we teach others, we improve ourselves, if someone does not know what you know, 
please share with him, and we all, will improve our skills together, it's cool, isn't?
